# Starbucks_Customer_Profiles
I will build customer profiles out of Starbucks satisfaction surveys

# Project Description:

* Analyze a data set comprised of Starbucks surveys and determine the drivers of customers indicating that they would not be returning to Starbucks to make a purchase

# Goal:

* Determine drivers of returning and non-returning customers

* Create a decision tree machine learning model that can predict weather a customer will be a returning customer based on the results of their survey 

* Using the decision tree, create a customer profile for returning and non-returning customers.

# Project Planning:

## Acquire
* Download csv with data from Kaggle
* Import data into notebook using Pandas 

## Prepare
* Deal with nulls
* Check for data types
* Create dummies 
* Split Data

## Explore
* Get Breakdown of returning non-returning customers
* Compare % non-returning against available variables to determine drivers of non-returning customers

## Modeling
* Create a decision tree to predict if a customer will be returning or non-returning

## Profiles
* Using the decision tree readout create a profile for returning and non-returning customers.
